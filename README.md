#Calculator project.

This was our first challenge in javascript.

The task was to build a simple calculator which can accept inputs, do some calculations, and return the outputs. The inputs will be generated from users clicking on the calculator buttons.

The goals for this project were:

A working Calculator:
Practice using Git and GitHub flow
Apply what we had learnt in html, css and javascript.
This project contains the followitn files: • index.html – it contains information about the calculator layout. • main.js – it contains the javascript files used to perform the different operations. • styles.css – with all the styling of the calculator.

Operations that the calculator can perform: • Addition • Subtraction • Divide • Multiply • Percentage • Clear • Decimal point • Clear

Improvements I would like to make.

I need to improve the style of the calculator, add some colours and make it look nicer.
I have to create a +/- button.
Make some changes in the code to make it neater and more efficient.
